== Easy ones ==
lxml
numpy
boto3
requests
eventlet
gunicorn
uwsgi
yaml-1.3
prometheus_client
git+https://github.com/mapproxy/mapproxy.git@master

== Dependencies ==
When I install mapproxy it will pull these in, so not in requirements.txt
pillow
PyYAML

== Hard ones ==
uwsgi, because you need a c compiler
imaging, because I don't know what this references
shapely because it needs libgeos library

How do I install these in Windows?
libgeos is needed by shapely
libproj is needed by mapproxy-util
